I hated the way I made the Assignment class and wanted to redo it, so I shall do that to begin this brain dump file
the initial conflict i dealt with for a few weeks (i wasn't prioritizing this project much) was the assignments vs. courses data structure
the very first thing i did was make each course an arraylist where the first element was the course name, i didn't like that.
i switched to an array of courses with a fixed size (default 10), and that array stored the arraylist datatype that contained the assignments for each course
i didn't really like that because of the off-chance I wanted something dynamically expanding later.

Courses are now stored as an ArrayList, storing the Course datatype that contains the course code, instructor, location, and credit count.
Maybe an average as well in the future, but I probably will never use that feature if I add it because of the LMS's built in average features.

The current conflict is, do I store assignments as one big list of assignments, or do I instantiate lists specific to each course that contain the assignments specific to that course?
I feel like this doesn't really matter. A master assignment list would present the challenge of determining which course the assignment belongs to, which
could be easily remedied by storing an "owner course" datatype for each assignment, which is what I had previously.
A master assignment list would require sorting or searching to get all the assignments specific to a course, but would streamline the retrieval of
all assignment objects, which would be nice on the frequent occasion a student wants to see their to-do list.
update - i could store each assignment in the list in a tree. if the course code is the first datatype seen by the tree, it would sort by course automatically

A separate assignment list for each course would make course-specific assignment retrieval very easy, as no searching or sorting a master list would be necessary
but, that would require retrieving lists for a number of courses I'm not fully aware of or don't control, so that might be tough to automate.

I could also make an assignment list as a member of each course, that might be easy but doesn't make much logical sense.
I think the best option is an assignment master list. Each assignment would need to store what course it belongs to, the number of points it's worth, the due date,
the assignment's title, and some kind of progress made on the assignment. Maybe also priority of the assignment, which can default to low if no priority is assigned
Functions performed on a specific assignment would be editing all its datatypes, deleting an assignment, prioritizing, marking as done, though these
might mix with editing its datatypes. The options most frequently accessed out of those would probably be prioritizing and marking as done.
Maybe I'd want to have each option displayed in some sort of list that reorders based on frequent or recent actions. I probably won't end up doing this,
but it would be fun to try and create my own implementation for that sort of thing. Assignment type is a maybe, I think that can be derived from titles though.
